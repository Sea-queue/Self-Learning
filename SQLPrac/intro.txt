What is Database (DB)?
----------------------
• any collection of related information
    > shopping list
    > to do list
• stored in different ways
    > on paper
    > in mind
    > on a computer
$: Computers are great for keeping track of LARGE AMOUNT of inforamtion


Two types of Databases:
------------------------
Relational Databases(SQL)   vs   Non-Relational Databases

Relational:
• Organize data into one or more tables:
    > Each table has columns and rows
    > A unique key identifies each row

Non-Relational:
• Anything but a traditional table
    > Graphs
    > Maps (key -value)
    > Documents


Relational Database Management System (RDBMS):
----------------------------------------------
• it's a software application
• use SQL to help users create and maintain a relational database:
    > mySQL
    > Oracal
    > mariaDB
    > postgreSQL


Structured Query Language (SQL):
--------------------------------
• standardized language for interacting with RDBMS
• C.R.U.D: Create, Read, Update, Delete

A hybrid language, it's actually 4 types of language in one
• Data Query Language(DQL):
    > query the database for information
    > get information that is already stored in database

• Data Definition Language(DDL):
    > define database schemes

• Data Control Language(DCL):
    > control access to the database
    > user permission management

• Data Manipulation Language(DML):
    > inserting, updating and deleting data


Non-relational Database Managemnet System (NRDBMS):
----------------------------------------------------
> mongoDB, dynamaDB

Implementation  specific:
-------------------------
There is no standard language. Mostly, each System has their own language.


Table Key:
----------
            surrogate key      vs   natural key:
no mapping to the real world   vs   has mapping to the real world
               "1, 2, 3 ..."   vs   "SSN"

foregin key: private key of another table
• could be stored as an element at the end of a table
• could be composite primary key of a table

composite key:
Two keys together uinique identify a row


Query:
------
Requests made to the database system for specific information
(a google search is query)

In other words: a set of instructions given to the RDBMS(written in SQL)
that tell the RDBMS what information you want.
    > TONS of data in a DB
    > Often hidden in a complex schema
    > Goal is only to get the data you need


In Terminal:
------------------------
mysql: command not found
After downloading mySQL:
echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
. ~/.bash_profile: reload       -- reload the bash_profile

mysql -u root -p                -- log in
create database <name>;         -- create a database
SHOW DATABSES;                  -- prints a list of databases
SHOW SCHEMAS;                   -- prints a list of databases

//Run sql file while connect to server:
mysql -uroot -p
source /Users/nsebhastian/Desktop/test/main.sql
or
\. /Users/nsebhastian/Desktop/test/main.sql

//Run sql file while not connect to server:
mysql -uroot -p school_db < /Users/nsebhastian/Desktop/test/main.sql


SQL basic:
----------
always ending with a ';'
must include ' ' between -- and comments

INT                     -- whole numbers
DECIMAL(M, N)           -- (total digits, digits after decimal point)
VARCHAR(1)              -- string of text of length 1
DATE                    -- 'yyyy-mm-dd'
TIMESTAMP               -- 'yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss'  used for recording
BLOB                    -- binary large object, stores large data
